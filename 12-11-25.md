so it's currently 4:08 am and such but motivation hit me so here we are. blog! 

no particular reason for wanting to start this but if i was going to write, 
why not make it available for the world to see too, no? Leave me be i enjoy my delerium. 

also to whomever this concerns, you will also very quickly learn that i, infact, do not know how to spell. 

won't ramble on for too long but might as well since first post and whatever. still learning how to code and
all that shit, its pretty fun but also it feels like one of those things that you either know how to do straight
out of the womb or you just don't. despite mankind surrounding themselves constantly with technology of their own 
creations, isn't it funny how little they understand how the thing in their pockets work? the small square of glass 
on the wrist, the should-probably-be a right angle abused chunk that is a laptop. completely disregarding the concept
of the internet btw. 

also i will put this down here too bc why not, humans trust themselves with so-called 'transportation' way too much too. 
*please* tell me why hurling down a road at...what, 90mph is perfectly calm and normal? public transport is a bit better 
since its not inherently reliant on steady hands to immediately murder yourself and all of the people around you, but still. 
what. 

but of course if i start nitpicking at everything wrong with mankind's self-made self-imposed world it would never end. 
alas, i will end my writing before the sun rises. wouldn't it be funny if this was my brand? only writing/posting at night?

hahaha. 

haha. 

ha. 

...

...goodnight.
